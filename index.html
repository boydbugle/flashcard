                <p>Naming convention (programming) In computer programming,
                  a naming convention is a set of rules for choosing the
                  character sequence to be used for identifiers which denote
                  variables, types, functions, and other entities in source
                  code and documentation.

            <div class="bottom">
                <p>In this sense, a function is a type of procedure or routine. Some programming languages make a distinction between a function, which returns a value, and a procedure, which performs some operation but does not return a value. Most programming
                    languages come with a prewritten set of functions that are kept in a library.</p>

                <p>In computer programming, a string is traditionally a sequence of characters, either as a literal constant or as some kind of variable. The latter may allow its elements to be mutated and the length changed, or it may be fixed (after creation)</p>

            <div class="bottom">
                <p>A method in object-oriented programming (OOP) is a procedure associated with a message and an object. An object is made up of data and behavior, which form the interface that an object presents to the outside world. Data is represented
                    as properties of the object and behavior as methods.</p>

                <p>Method chaining, also known as named parameter idiom, is a common syntax for invoking multiple method calls in object-oriented programming languages. Each method returns an object, allowing the calls to be chained together in a single
